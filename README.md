## 🎯 Game Overview

**Hue Knew** is designed to train your eye to distinguish between similar colors that are often confused, such as:
- Gamboge vs. Indian Yellow
- Muted Glaucous vs. Winter Glaucous
- Vermillion vs. Cinnabar
- Prussian Blue vs. Navy Blue

The game uses a progressive learning approach with two main phases:

### 📚 Learning Phase
- **Side-by-side comparison**: View two similar colors together with their names
- **Study the differences**: Learn the subtle variations that distinguish each color
- **Take your time**: No pressure - focus on understanding the nuances

### 🎮 Challenge Phase
- **Name-to-color matching**: Given a color name, select the correct hue
- **Color-to-name matching**: Given a color, choose the correct name
- **Multiple choice format**: Pick from carefully selected similar options
- **Immediate feedback**: Learn from mistakes with explanations

## 🌟 Features

- **Progressive difficulty**: Start with obvious differences, advance to subtle variations
- **Smart color pairs**: Curated color combinations that are commonly confused
- **Achievement system**: Track your progress and unlock new color categories
- **Streak tracking**: Monitor your learning momentum
- **Category-based learning**: Focus on specific color families (blues, yellows, reds, etc.)

## 🎨 Color Categories

- **Yellows**: Gamboge, Indian Yellow, Cadmium Yellow, Lemon Yellow
- **Blues**: Prussian Blue, Navy, Cerulean, Glaucous variations
- **Reds**: Vermillion, Cinnabar, Cadmium Red, Alizarin
- **Greens**: Viridian, Malachite, Forest Green, Sage
- **And many more...**

## 🏆 Learning Objectives

- **Develop color vocabulary**: Learn proper names for specific hues
