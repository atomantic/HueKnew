# Hue Knew üé®

The ability for humans to observe and record memmories of the world is limited by the language they have to describe it.

Hue Knew is an open-source SwiftUI color learning game that helps humans discover new colors, learn the subtle differences between similar colors, and learn their proper names.

## Goal

As a human, I want to be able to articulate the visual reality that humans experience with more accuracy. Rather than saying "that person is wearing a yellow-orange shirt with brown-ish accent lines," if I know the names of more colors, I can say, "that person is wearing a gamboge shirt with brown-sugar accent lines."

I want to be able to recognize colors in the real world and connect them to more distinct language.
I want to be able to hear a color name and visualize it in my mind.

## üéØ Game Overview

**Hue Knew** is designed to train your eye to distinguish between similar colors that are often confused, such as:
- ![](https://placehold.co/16x16/E49B0F/E49B0F.png) Gamboge (#E49B0F) vs. ![](https://placehold.co/16x16/E3B505/E3B505.png) Indian Yellow (#E3B505)

The game uses a progressive learning approach with two main phases:

### üìö Learning Phase
- **Side-by-side comparison**: View two similar colors together with their names
- **Study the differences**: Learn the subtle variations that distinguish each color
- **Take your time**: No pressure - focus on understanding the nuances

### üéÆ Challenge Phase
- **Name-to-color matching**: Given a color name, select the correct hue
- **Color-to-name matching**: Given a color, choose the correct name
- **Multiple choice format**: Pick from carefully selected similar options
- **Immediate feedback**: Learn from mistakes with explanations

## üåü Features

- **Progressive difficulty**: Start with obvious differences, advance to subtle variations
- **Smart color pairs**: Curated color combinations that are commonly confused
- **Achievement system**: Track your progress and unlock new color categories
- **Streak tracking**: Monitor your learning momentum
- **Category-based learning**: Focus on specific color families (blues, yellows, reds, etc.)

## üé® Color Categories

- **Yellows**: Gamboge, Indian Yellow, Cadmium Yellow, Lemon Yellow
- **Blues**: Prussian Blue, Navy, Cerulean, Glaucous variations
- **Reds**: Vermillion, Cinnabar, Cadmium Red, Alizarin
- **Greens**: Viridian, Malachite, Forest Green, Sage
- **And many more...**

## üèÜ Learning Objectives

- **Develop color vocabulary**: Learn proper names for specific hues
- **Train visual discrimination**: Improve ability to spot subtle differences
- **Build confidence**: Reduce uncertainty when describing colors
- **Practical application**: Use knowledge in art, design, and daily life
