mobile app game for teaching players the names of obscure colors.

## Color Picker Game Scaffolding

The `ColorPickerGame` directory contains a Swift package with the
initial SwiftUI scaffolding for a color picker guessing game. The app
displays a randomly generated color and allows players to pick a color
using `ColorPicker`. Press the **New Color** button to start a new
round with a different target color.

To build and run with Xcode:

```bash
open ColorPickerGame/Package.swift
```

Then select the `ColorPickerGame` scheme for an iOS simulator.
