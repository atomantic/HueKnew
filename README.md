The ability for humans to observe and record memories of the world is limited by the language they have to describe it.

Hue Knew is an open-source SwiftUI color learning game that helps humans discover new colors, learn the subtle differences between similar colors, and learn their proper names.

## 🎯 Goal

As a human, I want to be able to articulate the visual reality that humans experience with more accuracy. Rather than saying "that person is wearing a yellow-orange shirt with brown-ish accent lines," if I know the names of more colors, I can say, "that person is wearing a gamboge shirt with brown-sugar accent lines."

I want to be able to recognize colors in the real world and connect them to more distinct language.
I want to be able to hear a color name and visualize it in my mind.

The game uses a progressive learning approach with two main phases:

### 📚 Learning Phase
- **Side-by-side comparison**: View two similar colors together with their names
- **Study the differences**: Learn the subtle variations that distinguish each color
- **Take your time**: No pressure - focus on understanding the nuances

### 🎮 Challenge Phase
- **Name-to-color matching**: Given a color name, select the correct hue
- **Color-to-name matching**: Given a color, choose the correct name
- **Multiple choice format**: Pick from carefully selected similar options
- **Immediate feedback**: Learn from mistakes with explanations

## 🌟 Features

- **Progressive difficulty**: Start with obvious differences, advance to subtle variations
- **Smart color pairs**: Curated color combinations that are commonly confused
- **Achievement system**: Track your progress and unlock new color categories
- **Streak tracking**: Monitor your learning momentum
- **Category-based learning**: Focus on specific color families (blues, yellows, reds, etc.)

## 🎨 Color Categories

- **Yellows**: Gamboge, Indian Yellow, Cadmium Yellow, Lemon Yellow, Saffron, Goldenrod
- **Blues**: Prussian Blue, Navy, Cerulean, Glaucous, Ultramarine, Cobalt Blue
- **Reds**: Crimson, Firebrick, Vermillion, Carmine, Burgundy, Venetian Red
- **Greens**: Forest Green, Hunter Green, Viridian, Malachite, Sage, Emerald
- **Purples**: Purple, Midnight, Royal Purple, Lavender, Amethyst, Byzantium
- **Oranges**: Burnt Orange, Chocolate, Cadmium Orange, Tangerine, Marigold, Persimmon
- **Neutrals**: Dim Gray, Davy's Grey, Silver, Platinum, Ivory, Charcoal

## 🏆 Learning Objectives

- **Develop color vocabulary**: Learn proper names for specific hues
- **Train visual discrimination**: Improve ability to spot subtle differences
- **Build confidence**: Reduce uncertainty when describing colors
- **Practical application**: Use knowledge in art, design, and daily life

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start with Learning Mode**: Choose a color category to study
2. **Compare colors**: Study two similar colors side-by-side
3. **Read the differences**: Learn what makes each color unique
4. **Take the challenge**: Test your knowledge with randomized questions
5. **Track progress**: Build streaks and unlock new categories


## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Custom color sets**: Import your own color palettes
- **Timed challenges**: Speed rounds for advanced users
- **Color blindness support**: Accommodations for different vision types
- **Social features**: Share progress and compete with friends
- **Advanced analytics**: Detailed learning progress tracking
